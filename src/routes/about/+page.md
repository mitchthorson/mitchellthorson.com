## About

Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Mitchell Thorson, and I'm a data visualization specialist, web developer and information designer based in Brooklyn, New York. 

My work spans disciplines but is almost always centered around organizing and sharing data or other facts and information via the medium of the internet. Currently, I am a Lead Data Visualization Engineer at the <a href="https://www.urban.org" target="_blank">Urban Institute</a>, where I collaborate with public policy experts, data scientists and communications staff to present the organization's research through charts, maps and interactive online tools.

From 2014 â€“ February 2023 I was a part of the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/graphics" target="_blank">USA Today Graphics team</a>, where my work included a range of things from working with GIS data to build <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/pages/interactives/news/graphics/march-2020-tornado-path-nashville-cookeville-putnam-tennessee/" target="_blank">custom interactive maps</a>, to building automated data scrapers and pipelines that power <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2020/03/10/us-coronavirus-map-tracking-united-states-outbreak/4945223002/" target="_blank">online data presentations</a>, to working with data reporters to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2021/02/01/civil-war-during-trumps-pre-riot-speech-parler-talk-grew-darker/4297165001/" target="_blank">visualize sentiment analysis of social media data</a>. I also built and maintained many tools and templates that were used by members of the team to build and publish custom projects to the web.

My technical skills include:
- Building interactive and data-rich front-end web interfaces with component frameworks like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).
- Custom data visualization with D3.js.
- Digital cartography with command line tools, desktop GIS software, and browser-based vector tile mapping tools.
- Data analysis with R and Python.

Projects I've contributed to have been recognized with a variety of data visualization and journalism industry awards, including:

- 2023 Information is Beautiful Awards Gold Medal
